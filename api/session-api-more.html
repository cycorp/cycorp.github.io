  
<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>The primary use of the Session API is to provide the parameters so that the rest of the APIs can 
  access the desired Cyc.  If no configuration is provided, applications using the Cyc Java APIs 
  will pop up a window asking the user to specify the host and port where a Cyc server can be found.
  In contexts where no windowing is available, the program will suffer an unrecoverable error and 
  terminate. 
  
<p>A number of mechanisms are available to specify the Cyc server.  Details may be found on the 
  <a href="configuration/">Session API Configuration page</a>.</p>



<h3>Connection Management</h3>

<p>The Session API's SessionManager is ultimately responsible for overseeing connection pool 
  management. Connections may be reused across sessions, and in most cases, you should not need to 
  worry about directly creating, caching, or closing connections to Cyc servers. However, when 
  necessary, it is possible to force the SessionManager to close connections.</p>
