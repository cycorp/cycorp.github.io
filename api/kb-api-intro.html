The KB API provides basic functionality for manipulating CycL-based Java objects. 
The API extracts the main Predicate Logic constructs in the Cyc KB as Java classes. 
A set of factory classes allow finding and creating terms and assertions. These 
can be used to build sentences, to create new assertions or to build queries.
