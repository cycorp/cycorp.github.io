Each of the main packages in the Query API provides a specific piece of query-related functionality.

<h4>Asking a Query</h4>
<code>com.cyc.query.Query</code> provides the main functionality for running queries against a Cyc server.  Constructors
allow Queries to be created from CycL sentences (both as Sentence objects and as Strings), as well as from stored queries in the KB
(i.e., using the constructor that takes a KBIndividual). Answers from the Cyc query can be retrieved using
<code>isTrue</code>, <code>isProvable</code>, <code>getResultSet</code>, <code>getAnswers</code>, and related methods.

<p/>
One crucial thing to note about the <code>Query</code> class is that if a query is either browsable (c.f. <code>setBrowsable</code>) or continuable (c.f. <code>setContinuable</code>),
it is up to the Java application developer to <code>close()</code> each of the Query objects when finished with it.
Continuable and browsable query objects are wrappers around server-side query objects and, if not
properly closed, they will lead to a potentially severe memory leak.

<h4>Constructing a Query from English</h4>
The package <code>com.cyc.km.query.construction</code> is designed to allow the construction of CycL query sentences 
based on natural language strings.  It does not provide a completely automated "English --> CycL" translation capability, but
instead provides a way of generating small query "fragments" that can be combined, with the guidance of a human, into a relevant
CycL query.  The <code>QuerySearch</code> class provides methods that allow a UI to show which fragments 
were produced from which parts of the input string, thereby making it clearer to a user how the fragments
are related to the input.  Fragments produced this way can be combined into larger queries using
some of the methods on the Query class (e.g., <code>merge</code>, <code>findConnectedClauses</code> and others).

<h4>Exporting Query Results</h4>
The package <code>com.cyc.km.query.export</code> provides an abstract <code>ResultsExporter</code> class,
for exporting query results, as well as two reference implementations of it for CSV and XML formats. Exporting works
by outputting a document to a <code>PrintWriter</code>, <code>PrintStream</code>, or String, consisting
of a header, a section describing the query, a section enumerating the answers, and a footer.

<h4>Explaining the Rationale for an Answer</h4>
The <code>com.cyc.km.query.answer.justification</code> package provides support for
generating structured explanations for inference answers. A justification object can
be constructed using <code>new ProofViewJustification(InferenceAnswer)</code>, for
any answer returned by <code>Query.getAnswers()</code>. The justification has a tree
structure, whose root node is returned by <code>getRoot()</code>. Each <code>Node</code>
has associated CycL and NL (formatted in HTML) that can be rendered in an
interactive interface, as well as accessors to get its parent and children nodes.
Additionally, an entire Justification can be exported to XML via the <code>ProofViewMarhaller</code>
class.
