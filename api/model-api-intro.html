        <p>
        The Model API is a JAXB-like framework that partially maps First Order Predicate Logic constructs to Object Oriented (OO) constructs
        to facilitate application development. The API consolidates frequently used logic to OO idioms and generates a domain specific API
        given a vocabulary subset from the KB. </p><p>

        The Knowledge Base is a Predicate Logic-based model of real-world domain/concepts. Developing applications using a typical
        OO language requires translating the KB-based model to OO model. MAPI automates this process to streamline application development
        targeting the KB. It avoids duplication and inconsistency of hand-written OO models, helps reflect OE changes naturally to OO,
        supports a typical IDE in identifying changes at compile time, and provides OE details in the IDE.</p><p>

        The Domain Specific APIs generated by this API typically refer to real-world object, rather than Predicate Logic representations as in the KB API
        and implementation representations as in Base API.</p>
