        The KM API is a suite of commonly used tools to extract, modify and add new KB knowledge.
        These tools help visualize the KB content, search via NL, constrain results based on input conditions,
        and execute template queries. Additional tools extract and generate KB content from and to standard representations
        such as OWL. The API also provides tools to control and format the Query output to varying degrees of detail.
