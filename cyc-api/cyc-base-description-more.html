  

  <p>The functionality available through the <code>com.cyc.base</code> interfaces is part of
  the supported Cyc Base API.  <em>Additional</em> functionality, beyond that defined in the Base API,
  is available through the <code>com.cyc.baseclient</code> classes. However, the additional
  functionality of the Base Client is largely provided either for backwards compatibility
  or to facilitate particular implementation issues; 
  as such, it may be changed or removed at any time. For this reason, developers are encouraged
  to write code strictly against the functionality defined in the Base API whenever possible.</p>
  
  <p>In order to use the Base API (or any of the higher-level APIs), the Java program must know how to communicate with
  the Cyc server. The CycAccess object provides the basic communications facilities, and is generally 
  kept track of in a thread-local variable.  Below is one simple way to set the CycAccess for the current thread:</p>
  <pre>
  CycAccessManager.get().setCurrentAccess("localhost", 3600));
  </pre>
  <p>In some situations, the user may be allowed to specify the location of the Cyc image (e.g., in
  applications that may run against different Cyc servers at different times).  In
  these situations, the <code>InteractiveCycAccessProvider</code> can be helpful:</p>
  <pre>
  CycAccessManager.get().setCurrentAccess(InteractiveCycAccessProvider.get().getAccess("localhost", 3600));
  </pre>
  <p>The code above will first check to see if there is a valid Cyc image at <code>localhost:3600</code>.  If it
  is able to find one there, it will use it.  If it is not able to contact the Cyc server at
  that location, it will interactively prompt the user to provide the host and port for the desired Cyc server.</p>
