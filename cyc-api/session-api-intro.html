  The Session API defines the basic functionality for connecting to a Cyc server, and is used for this 
  purpose by all the other Cyc APIs.  The Session API replaces the need to directly manage
  the configuration, creation, and caching of CycAccess objects that was common in the (now-deprecated) OpenCyc API.
