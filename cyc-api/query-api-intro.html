The Query API provides some classes and methods for requesting and handling answers to 
arbitrarily complex questions posed to a Cyc server. Query objects specify such requests 
and store the answers, and can be constructed by specifying a query sentence with zero 
or more open variables, an optional microtheory, and other parameters to guide and control 
the inference process. Alternatively, predefined query specifications can be loaded from a 
Cyc KB, or natural language questions can be used to produce Query objects that can then be modified or combined prior 
to being run. Inference answers can be inspected, with representations of variable bindings 
in CycL and NL, and complete CycL sentences for each answer. They can also be iterated over 
using a SQL-style result set, and can be exported in CSV or XML formats.
