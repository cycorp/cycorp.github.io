  The Base API defines the basic functionality for connecting to a Cyc server handling Heuristic Level (HL) data. 
It is the foundational API upon which the other Cyc APIs are built. 
Although the Base API is versatile, it is generally recommended that users employ
the higher-level APIs (such as the KB API and the Query API) when possible.<p>
	 
The reference implementation of the Base API (<code>com.cyc.base.*</code>) is the Base Client 
(<code>com.cyc.baseclient.*</code>). These supercede the OpenCyc API, which is deprecated, though many 
of the Base API's interfaces resemble OpenCyc API classes.
