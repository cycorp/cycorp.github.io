The Base Client is a library used by the Java API, but is not itself part of the Cyc Java API.  
Largely derived from the now-deprecated OpenCyc API, it is subject to change without notice, and 
developers are strongly discouraged from using anything in the Base Client.  However, its source code is available
to developers, and inspecting it may help developers better understand how the API itself works (or fails to
work, in the case of bugs). Please note that the Base Client is <em>not supported</em> for external developers.
